# Personal-Bank
An program that uses a CLI to simulate basic banking operations.

This program does not use real money in anyway, nor does it have the capability to connect to real accounts.

To run this program on windows:
Open the command propmt and navigate to the directory this was downloaded to. Then, input "python bankingApp.py" to run.

During the program:
The application will first generate a .db file named "PersonalBank" into the same folder for your information to be saved in. Then you will be prompted to make a selection. Most operation inputs will require a single digit input to proceed (Ex. "1", "2").

When prompted to input the an account number, the user must include '#' followed by the four digits of the acutal account number (Ex. #5555).
